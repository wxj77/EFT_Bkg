Elizabeth: alpha rate for Rn chain.

No Xenon 127 is considered now, because no lines are seen at high energy for this EC decay(from Evan, Kelsey), even though it could still exist with small number.

The energy of the is assumed to be a uniform distribution in xenon space for 

I cannot use the Bkg_rphidrift_TH3F_RnKr_TB{timeBin}.root to estimate the expected uniform distribution for signal model or ^{8}B, ^{37}Ar. Because the single scatter activity is higher on the edge of the detector(this is the result I saw from the simulation).
